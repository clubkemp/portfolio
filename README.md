# Jonny Kemp Portfolio

## Description 

Refactor refactor refactor. That's how you get better by constantly rebuilding what you've already done. This repo constitutes a v2 of my attempts at building a portfolio. Using the original [portfolio](https://clubkemp.github.io/uw-portfolio/) page where we used bootstrap, I was able to get most of my content copy. 

I wanted to experiment with different css frameworks, and was often frustrated on tearing down the bootstrap stylingto get the exact look it wanted. Don't get me wrong, bootstrap looks really good, but as soon as you want to change that look it can be frustrating. I landed on using Pure CSS for the grid and a few componenets, and shoelace JS as a way to expand on the component sets. WOrked like a charm
